This project is a further solidifying of JavaScript fundamentals.

The tool employs basic JavaScript tools and data structures.
It accepts user input and dynamically creates new items to be displayed in the DOM.

Arrays and objects are heavily relied on here in order to
keep the library updated and matching with user input.

Future changes include refactoring some DOM manipulation into smaller helper functions, and creating a storage system so the library is saved for the user.
