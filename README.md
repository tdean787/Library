This project is primarily centered around DOM manipulation and creating new content and objects as a result of user input.

The library is an array of Book objects, and each one is represented as a table row. 

Future changes include refactoring some DOM manipulation into smaller helper functions, and creating a storage system so the library is saved for the user.
